# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve codexU.

## Development

Build the app:

```sh
make build
```

Run locally:

```sh
make run
```

Check the local data reader:

```sh
make probe
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused on one bug fix or feature.
- Run `make build` before opening a pull request.
- Update `README.md` or `DISTRIBUTION.md` when behavior, installation, permissions, or packaging changes.
- Avoid committing local build outputs from `build/` or `dist/`.

## Privacy

codexU reads local Codex files from `~/.codex/`. Do not include real account data, thread titles, local paths, screenshots with private task names, or local SQLite data in issues or pull requests.
